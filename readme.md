# Blastar by Elon Musk

Blastar was a game written by Elon Musk in 1984 (at the age of 12). The source code was published in a magazine and he received $500 for it.
Elon has since moved beyond 8-bit spaceships.

"[It was] a trivial game... but better than Flappy Bird."

## Install

You can run it in OpenMSX if you configure it to be a Spectravideo 328, open the console (F10) and run: 

```
type_from_file "/home/user/blastar/blastar.txt"
```

Then it will be typed into the emulator and it's possible to run it. Make sure to enable fast forward with F9 to speed up the process.
Also don't forget to enable the joystick in OpenMSX-menu (press Windows Option-button ) > Hardware > Connectors > MSX joystick port A > keyjoystick1. You can stop the BASIC-program running by using CTRL-F8.
